# HexSoftwares_Task-2 
🎬 Movie Ratings Analysis & Visualization:
📌 Project Overview:
This project analyzes and visualizes movie ratings data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.
It uses Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in a Jupyter Notebook to perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
The workflow is fully customizable — you can plug in your own dataset (CSV) to get instant insights.

📂 Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing.
Handle missing values (mean/mode fill).
Remove duplicates.
Standardize column names.
Convert ratings to numeric format.
Summary Statistics.
Mean, Median, Mode of ratings.
Data Visualizations.
Ratings distribution histogram.
Top-rated movies list.
Year vs Age Limit distribution.
Age Limit vs Rating comparison.
Name vs Ratings chart.
Export for Dashboards.
Cleaned dataset ready for Tableau or Power BI.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python: Data analysis & visualization
Pandas: Data handling
NumPy: Numerical calculations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Charts & plots
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis

📊 How It Works:
Load Dataset – Provide any movie ratings dataset in CSV format.
Clean Data – Handle missing data, standardize columns.
Analyze – Generate descriptive statistics.
Visualize – Create various charts to explore patterns.
Export – Save cleaned data for external dashboards.

📥 Dataset Suggestions:
You can use any open movie dataset. Recommended options from Kaggle:
IMDb Top 1000 Movies Dataset
TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset
MovieLens Dataset

🎯 Conclusion:
This project demonstrated how raw movie rating data can be transformed into meaningful insights through effective data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
By analyzing trends across genres, age limits, and release years, it became clear how audience preferences and rating patterns evolve over time.
The visualizations not only highlight top-rated movies but also reveal broader industry patterns — showing the power of data in understanding entertainment trends.
